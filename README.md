## Background

Regression is a statistical tool used to understand and quantify the relation between two or more variables. Regressions range from simple models to highly complex equations. The two primary uses for regression in business are forecasting and optimization. This repository is for me to note concepts, and practice technical implementation from simple linear regression to advanced machine learning regression techniques. It will be useful for you to view if you are interested in comprehensive conceptual and technical explanation of Regression Analysis.
